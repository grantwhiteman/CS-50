Operators:

  Arithmetic:
    add +, subtract -, multiply *, divide /;
    modulus operator % gives us remainder;
    int m = 13 % 4 //m is now 1;
    
    Shorthand:
      x *= 5;
      incrementing a variable:
        x++;
        x--;
  Boolean expressions:
    used for comparing values;
    takes values of true or false;
    Often used with if or while statements
    Every non-zero value has a value true or false
    0 is false, everything else is true!
    
    Split up into logical operators and relational operators
      Logical AND (x && y);
        only true if both x and y are true
      Logical OR (x || y);
        true if either x or y is true
      Logical NOT (!);
        inverts true/false to false/true
      Relational comparisons (x < y); (x <= y); (x > y); etc.;
      Relational equality/inequality (x ==y); (x != y);
