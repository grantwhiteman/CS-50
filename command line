CS50 IDE runs Ubuntu, one of the many flavors of Linux OS
UNIX commands (linux and mac)
ls = lists contents of current directory
  green = executable, black = text files, blue = folders
cd <directory> = changes directory to whatever
  current dirrectory shorthand is '.'
  parent directory shorthand is '..'
  pwd (poresent working directory) will tell you your current directory
  mkdir <foldername> creates folder in current directory
  cp <source> <destination> copies a file to a destination name, can't work with folders (folder and name or just folder?)
  rm <file>
  rm -f forces removal of file (ie. doesnt ask if you're sure you want to delete it)
  rm -r  recursively deletes a directory
  mv <source> <destination> moves a file, essentially renaming it
  
  if we want to go in 'pset1' for example
  cd pset1 (this can only go forward)
  cd . does nothing
  cd .. goes backward one level
  cd      goes backward to start
  cd ../..  goes backward twice
  if you're lost
  type pwd
  cp hello.txt hi.txt
  rm hi.txt
  
  cp -r pset0 pset3 (-r means recursive, copies entire directory, including contents)
  rm -r pset3 (deletes entire folder)
  rm -rf pset3 (recursively forcably deletes a folder)
